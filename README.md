**Quantum vs Classical CNN-LSTM Network Intrusion Detection System with Advanced Probabilistic Reasoning**

## 🎯 Project Objective

Demonstrate that **QCNN-QLSTM hybrid models** with **Bayesian probabilistic reasoning** are more advanced and have significant advantages over **classical CNN-LSTM models** for Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS).

### 🧠 Dual-Focus Approach

This project integrates two critical machine learning paradigms:

1. **Deep Learning (DL)**: Quantum-enhanced CNN-LSTM architectures for pattern recognition
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning (PR)**: Bayesian inference, uncertainty quantification, and risk-based decision making

## 🚀 Quick Start

# Complete comparison with both models
python main.py --sample-size 5000 --model both

# View all options
python main.py --help
```
