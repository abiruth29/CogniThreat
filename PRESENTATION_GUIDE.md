## ‚ùì Anticipated Questions & Answers

### Q1: "Why quantum-inspired instead of real quantum computing?"
**A:** Current quantum hardware (NISQ devices) has limited qubits and high error rates. Quantum-inspired algorithms run on classical hardware while capturing quantum advantages like superposition and entanglement principles. This makes our solution practical and deployable today.

### Q2: "How does Bayesian fusion improve over simple averaging?"
**A:** Bayesian fusion uses probabilistic weights based on model confidence and posterior distributions. It accounts for model disagreement (epistemic uncertainty) and can adaptively weight models based on their reliability for specific inputs. Simple averaging treats all models equally.

### Q3: "What's the difference between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty?"
**A:** 
- **Aleatoric**: Irreducible uncertainty from noisy data (e.g., incomplete network packets)
- **Epistemic**: Uncertainty from limited model knowledge, reducible with more training data

This decomposition tells us whether to collect more data or accept inherent noise.

### Q4: "Why is missing an attack 10x worse than a false alarm?"
**A:** In cybersecurity, missing a real attack (False Negative) can lead to data breaches, system compromise, and financial losses. False alarms (False Positives) are inconvenient but don't cause damage. This 10:1 ratio reflects real-world security priorities.

### Q5: "How does this compare to existing NIDS?"
**A:** Traditional NIDS like Snort/Suricata use rule-based detection. ML-based NIDS exist but typically:
- Lack uncertainty quantification
- Use simple ensembles without Bayesian fusion
- Don't incorporate risk-based decision making
- Miss quantum-inspired enhancements

Our system combines all these advantages.

### Q6: "Can this detect zero-day attacks?"
**A:** Partially. The hybrid architecture and uncertainty quantification help identify anomalous patterns. High epistemic uncertainty signals "unknown unknowns" - potential zero-days. However, no NIDS can guarantee zero-day detection without prior similar patterns.

### Q7: "What about computational overhead?"
**A:** Quantum-inspired layers add ~15-20% computation vs classical CNN-LSTM. PR module adds ~5% overhead. Total: ~20-25% slower but with 2-5% accuracy gains and uncertainty awareness - a worthy trade-off for critical security applications.

### Q8: "How did you validate the probabilistic reasoning?"
**A:** We used:
- Cross-validation on CIC-IDS-2017 dataset
- Uncertainty decomposition analysis
- Risk score validation against ground truth
- Ensemble consistency checks
- Ablation studies (removing PR to show impact)
