## 📞 EMERGENCY REFERENCE

**If professor asks:** "Walk me through one sample"  
**Answer:** "Let me show you our port scan: 511 connections in 5 seconds with 100% SYN errors. After normalization, the z-score for error rate is 3.167—way above normal. The quantum CNN encodes this to q2=-0.91 using angle embedding. The LSTM accumulates evidence over 10 time steps, growing from 64% to 99% confidence. Final classification: Attack with 99.9955% probability, confirmed by Bayesian analysis with only ±0.0012% uncertainty."

**If professor asks:** "What's novel here?"  
**Answer:** "Three things: (1) Quantum entanglement captures attack correlations that classical CNNs miss—we gain +5.7% accuracy. (2) Bayesian uncertainty quantification tells us WHEN to trust the model—critical for real-world deployment. (3) Temporal HMM forecasts future attack states—we know this attack will persist for 4 more time steps, enabling proactive defense."

**If professor asks:** "Can this scale?"  
**Answer:** "Yes! We use only 4 qubits per group, which is practical on current quantum simulators. 98% of computation is classical (LSTM, dense layers). We've tested on 2.8M flows from CIC-IDS-2017. Bayesian adds ~2 seconds overhead, acceptable for network IDS. The quantum part can run on near-term quantum hardware when available."
