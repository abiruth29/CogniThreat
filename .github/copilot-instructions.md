- [x] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created.

- [x] Clarify Project Requirements
	<!-- CogniThreat AI-driven intrusion detection system with quantum deep learning and explainable AI using Python 3.10+, PennyLane, Qiskit, TensorFlow, SHAP, LIME, and Streamlit -->

- [x] Scaffold the Project
	<!-- Project structure created with all directories, source files, tests, notebooks, and documentation. Includes Quantum LSTM, Quantum CNN, SHAP/LIME XAI, and Streamlit dashboard implementations. -->

- [x] Customize the Project
	<!-- All Partner B modules implemented: Quantum LSTM/CNN with PennyLane integration, SHAP/LIME XAI with trust metrics, interactive Streamlit dashboard, comprehensive test suite, and demo notebooks. Ready for development and integration. -->

- [x] Install Required Extensions
	<!-- No specific extensions required for this Python-based quantum ML project -->

- [x] Compile the Project
	<!-- Python environment configured with virtual environment. Core packages installed: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, streamlit, shap, lime, pennylane, tensorflow. Project ready for development and testing. -->

- [x] Create and Run Task
	<!-- Task created for environment setup and dependency installation. All required packages including quantum libraries (PennyLane, Qiskit), ML frameworks (TensorFlow), XAI libraries (SHAP, LIME), and dashboard tools (Streamlit) are being installed. -->
